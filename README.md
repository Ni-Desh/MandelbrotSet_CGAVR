# MandelbrotSet_CGAVR
This code generates the Mandelbrot Set using an iterative method with OpenGL, plotting each point based on how quickly it escapes a bounded region in the complex plane. Grayscale coloring represents the iteration count, and a zoom animation is added by gradually scaling the viewing window over time.
